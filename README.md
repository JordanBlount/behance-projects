# Overview

This repository is being used to recreate designs that I have come across on Behance in HTML and CSS.

I am trying to practice my skills in recreating the visual parts of a website using what I have learned in [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) and also in a [CSS Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) by Kevin Powell.

# Projects

The are currently ordered in the way I did them.

1. **Marvin Walter - Portfolio**: [Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/119294015/Marvin-Walter-Portfolio-Webdesign-Webdevelopment) to the original design



2. **SAKI**:  [Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/119231721/SAKI-Second-Hand-Webdesign-Webdevelopment) to the original design

   This particular design was not easy for me to implement. I need to better understand what is going on here. I did my best to recreate it accurately.

   

   Issues: The font sizes need to be fized for each letter of the brand name. The sizing causes some inherent padding on the letters which I do not know how to remove. This pushes the taglines (description text for each letter) down.

3. **QStudio**: [Link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/115730041/QStudio-Online-Magazine) to the original design
