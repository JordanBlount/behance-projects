This repository is being used to recreate designs that I have come across on Behance in HTML and CSS.

I am trying to practice my skills in recreating the visual parts of a website using what I have learned in [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) and also in a [CSS Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) by Kevin Powell.
